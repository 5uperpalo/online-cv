title = "Towards High-Fidelity and Trustworthy Digital Twins for Fault Diagnosis in Grid Connected Inverters",
abstract = "Automating the task of fault detection and diagnosis is essential for reducing the operational and maintenance costs of power electronic converters. Hence, this paper introduces an online optimization methodology for digital twins to diagnose multiple faults in grid connected inverters. In addition to enhancing accuracy, we channelize our efforts towards reducing computational complexity in parameter configuration under a limited set of training data. To address cybersecurity vulnerabilities during the training phase of our digital twin, we perform data sanitization with the aid of a quantitative association rule mining technique. For classification performance assessment, various fault cases in a virtual synchronous generator are considered to demonstrate the efficacy of our approach. Our research outcomes reveal increased accuracy and fidelity levels achieved by our digital-twin design, paving the way for reliable and trustworthy decision-making under anomalous conditions.",

abstract={The increasing demand for efficient resource allocation in mobile networks has catalyzed the exploration of innovative solutions that could enhance the task of real-time cellular traffic prediction. Under these circumstances, federated learning (FL) stands out as a distributed and privacy-preserving solution to foster collaboration among different sites, thus enabling responsive near-the-edge solutions. In this paper, we comprehensively study the potential benefits of FL in telecommunications through a case study on federated traffic forecasting using real-world data from base stations (BSs) in Barcelona (Spain). Our study encompasses relevant aspects within the federated experience, including model aggregation techniques, outlier management, the impact of individual clients, personalized learning, and the integration of exogenous sources of data. The performed evaluation is based on both prediction accuracy and sustainability, thus showcasing the environmental impact of employed FL algorithms in various settings. The findings from our study highlight FL as a promising and robust solution for mobile traffic prediction, emphasizing its twin merits as a privacy-conscious and environmentally sustainable approach, while also demonstrating its capability to overcome data heterogeneity and ensure high-quality predictions, marking a significant stride towards its integration in mobile traffic management systems.},

abstract = {Internet access is a special resource of which needs has become universal across the public whereas the service is operated in the private sector. Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) put efforts for management, planning, and optimization; however, they do not link such activities to socioeconomic fairness. In this paper, we make a first step towards understanding the relation between socioeconomic status of customers and network performance, and investigate potential discrimination in network deployment and management. The scope of our study spans various aspects, including urban geography, network resource deployment, data consumption, and device distribution. A novel methodology that enables a geo-socioeconomic perspective to mobile network is developed for the study. The results are based on an actual infrastructure in multiple cities, covering millions of users densely covering the socioeconomic scale. We report a thorough examination of the fairness status, its relationship with various structural factors, and potential class specific solutions.},
